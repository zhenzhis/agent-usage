Security-hardened local AI coding agent usage & cost tracker for teams that want private token accounting without external infrastructure.  
Single binary + SQLite — local-first, auditable, and safe to run behind a localhost-only dashboard.

**[中文文档](README_CN.md)**

Collects local session data from Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, OpenCode, kiro, and Pi, calculates costs automatically, and presents token usage, cost trends, and session details through a web dashboard.

## Fork Notice

This repository is a second-development fork by **ZhenZhi** based on [briqt/agent-usage](https://github.com/briqt/agent-usage). We keep the core collection and API model aligned with the upstream project, and extend it with security hardening, safer local deployment defaults, pinned CI, vendored frontend assets, and a quant-style operating dashboard.

Thanks to the original author and contributors of [briqt/agent-usage](https://github.com/briqt/agent-usage/) for the clean single-binary foundation.

## Features

- 📁 **Local file parsing** — reads Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenClaw, Pi session files, OpenCode SQLite database, and kiro session/database files directly
- 💰 **Automatic cost calculation** — fetches model pricing from [litellm](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm), supports backfill when prices update
- 🗄️ **SQLite storage** — single file, zero ops, data is correctable
- 📊 **Web dashboard** — dark-themed UI with ECharts: cost breakdown, token trends, session list
- 🔄 **Incremental scanning** — watches for new sessions, deduplicates automatically
- 📦 **Single binary** — `go:embed` packs the web UI into the executable
- 🖥️ **Cross-platform** — Linux, macOS, Windows

## ZhenZhi Edition Optimizations

- **Local-only Docker default** — compose publishes `127.0.0.1:9800`, builds the local checkout, and mounts Claude/Codex/OpenCode read-only by default.
- **HTTP hardening** — explicit server timeouts plus CSP, frame, content-type, referrer, and permissions headers.
- **Frontend supply-chain reduction** — ECharts is vendored into the embedded static bundle; no CDN scripts or Google Fonts are loaded at runtime.
- **Scanner integrity** — JSONL collectors check scanner errors before inserting records or advancing file offsets, preventing silent truncation on oversized or unreadable lines.
- **OpenCode source cost preservation** — OpenCode-reported per-message costs are stored directly before pricing backfill, so custom providers such as GLM or DeepSeek do not appear as `$0`.
- **Bounded pricing sync** — litellm pricing fetch checks HTTP status, uses a User-Agent, and caps response size.
- **Pinned automation** — release/docker actions are pinned by SHA; CI runs tests, vet, and `govulncheck@v1.3.0`.
- **Monochrome operations UI** — black/white/gray, dense, operation-oriented dashboard with activity matrix, token throughput, model allocation, cost trend, and a sortable session ledger.

## Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
# One command to start
mkdir -p ./data && docker compose up --build -d

# Open dashboard
open http://localhost:9800
```

The default `docker-compose.yml` builds the local checkout and publishes the dashboard only on `127.0.0.1:9800`. Keep that localhost binding unless you add your own reverse proxy or authentication layer. It mounts Claude, Codex, and OpenCode session data read-only by default:

- `~/.claude/projects` → `/sessions/claude`
- `~/.codex/sessions` → `/sessions/codex`
- `~/.local/share/opencode` → `/sessions/opencode`

These mounts use `create_host_path: false`, so missing host paths fail explicitly instead of being silently created by Docker. To collect OpenClaw, kiro, or Pi usage, uncomment the matching read-only volume in `docker-compose.yml` and set that collector to `enabled: true` in `config.docker.yaml` or your custom config. Data persists in `./data/`.

> **Note:** Only enable mounts for agents you actually use. Docker creates missing host directories as root, which can interfere with tools like `npx skills add` that detect installed agents by directory existence.

The container uses `config.docker.yaml` by default (binds to `0.0.0.0` inside the container, stores data in `/data/`). Host exposure is controlled by the compose port binding above. To override, mount your own config:

```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml, uncomment:
volumes:
  - ./config.yaml:/etc/agent-usage/config.yaml:ro
```

See [Docker Details](#docker-details) for UID/GID permissions and local builds.

## Query Usage from Agent Conversations

The skill works standalone — no need to install or run the agent-usage server. It parses local JSONL session files directly. If the agent-usage server is detected, it automatically switches to API queries for more accurate cost data.

```bash
# Installed via vercel-labs/skills, supports Claude Code, Cursor, kiro, and 40+ agents
npx skills add zhenzhis/agent-usage -y
```

Once installed, try: `查下 agent usage`、`agent usage 统计` or `check agent usage`. See [`skills/agent-usage/SKILL.md`](skills/agent-usage/SKILL.md) for details.

## Configuration

```yaml
server:
  port: 9800
  bind_address: "127.0.0.1"  # use "0.0.0.0" for remote access

collectors:
  claude:
    enabled: true
    paths:
      - "~/.claude/projects"
    scan_interval: 60s
  codex:
    enabled: true
    paths:
      - "~/.codex/sessions"
    scan_interval: 60s
  openclaw:
    enabled: true
    paths:
      - "~/.openclaw/agents"
    scan_interval: 60s
  opencode:
    enabled: true
    paths:
      - "~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db"
    scan_interval: 60s
  kiro:
    enabled: true
    paths:
      - "~/.local/share/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3"
    scan_interval: 60s

storage:
  path: "./agent-usage.db"

pricing:
  sync_interval: 1h  # fetched from GitHub; set HTTPS_PROXY env var if this fails
```

Config search order: `--config` flag > `/etc/agent-usage/config.yaml` > `./config.yaml`.

## Supported Data Sources

| Source | Session Location | Format |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | `~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl` | JSONL |
| [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) | `~/.codex/sessions/<year>/<month>/<day>/<session>.jsonl` | JSONL |
| [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) | `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions/<sessionId>.jsonl` | JSONL |
| [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) | `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` | SQLite |
| [kiro](https://kiro.dev) | `~/.local/share/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3` | SQLite |
| [Pi](https://pi.dev) | `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<workspace>/<session>.jsonl` | JSONL |

### Adding New Sources

Each source needs a collector that:
1. Scans session directories for JSONL files
2. Parses entries and extracts token usage per API call
3. Writes records to SQLite via the storage layer

See `internal/collector/claude.go` as a reference implementation.

## Dashboard

The web dashboard provides:

- **Control surface** — time presets, date range, granularity, source/model filters, theme, language, and auto-refresh
- **KPI strip** — total tokens, cost, sessions, prompts, calls, cache rate, and per-call metrics
- **Activity matrix** — commit-heatmap inspired token activity by input/output/cache channel
- **Token throughput** — stacked token bars for input, output, cache read, and cache write
- **Cost trend** — stacked cost bars by model with stable grayscale series
- **Model allocation** — horizontal ranking for top model spend
- **Session ledger** — sortable, filterable table with expandable per-model detail
- **Dark/Light theme** — monochrome dark-first default with manual toggle
- **i18n** — English and Chinese
- **Timezone handling** — all timestamps are stored in UTC; the frontend automatically converts to your browser's local timezone for date pickers, chart X-axis labels, and session timestamps

## Architecture

The application stays intentionally small: collectors read local agent artifacts, storage normalizes usage into SQLite, pricing enriches records, and the embedded HTTP server serves both REST endpoints and the dashboard.

Security boundaries:

- Session directories are mounted read-only in Docker examples.
- The dashboard is unauthenticated and therefore binds to localhost by default.
- Static assets are embedded; runtime UI does not fetch third-party scripts or fonts.
- Pricing sync is the only expected outbound request during normal operation.

## Cost Calculation

Pricing is fetched from [litellm's model price database](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/blob/main/model_prices_and_context_window.json) and stored locally.

```
cost = (input - cache_read - cache_creation) × input_price
     + cache_creation × cache_creation_price
     + cache_read × cache_read_price
     + output × output_price
```

When prices update, historical records are automatically backfilled.

## API Endpoints

All endpoints accept `from` and `to` (YYYY-MM-DD) query parameters. Optional: `source` (`claude`, `codex`, `openclaw`, `opencode`, `kiro`, `pi`) to filter by agent, `model` to filter by model name, `granularity` (`1m`, `30m`, `1h`, `6h`, `12h`, `1d`, `1w`, `1M`) for time-series endpoints.

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/stats` | Summary: total cost, tokens, sessions, prompts, API calls |
| `GET /api/cost-by-model` | Cost grouped by model |
| `GET /api/cost-over-time` | Cost time series (supports `granularity`) |
| `GET /api/tokens-over-time` | Token usage time series (supports `granularity`) |
| `GET /api/sessions` | Session list with cost/token totals |
| `GET /api/session-detail?session_id=ID` | Per-model breakdown for a session |

Invalid date formats or reversed date ranges return a `400` JSON error with a descriptive message.

## Tech Stack

- **Go** — pure Go, no CGO required
- **SQLite** via [`modernc.org/sqlite`](https://pkg.go.dev/modernc.org/sqlite) — pure Go SQLite driver
- **ECharts** — charting library
- **`go:embed`** — single binary deployment

## Docker Details

The default compose file builds from source so local security fixes are included. Release workflows publish multi-arch images (amd64 + arm64) to this repository's GHCR namespace.

The default `docker-compose.yml` runs as UID 1000. If your host user has a different UID, edit the `user:` field:

```bash
# Check your UID/GID
id -u  # e.g. 1000
id -g  # e.g. 1000

# Edit docker-compose.yml: user: "YOUR_UID:YOUR_GID"
```

This is required because `~/.claude/projects` is mode 700 — only the owning UID can read it.

### Building locally

```bash
docker build -t agent-usage:local .

# For China mainland, use GOPROXY:
docker build --build-arg GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn,direct -t agent-usage:local .
```

When using Docker directly, bind only to localhost unless you have added access control:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:9800:9800 agent-usage:local
```
