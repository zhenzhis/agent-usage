# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Official Agent Ledger naming across module path, binary, Docker, release metadata, and documentation.
- Pricing governance with local override, official OpenAI/Anthropic seed rows, LiteLLM fallback, pricing source health, snapshots, audit events, and per-record pricing confidence.
- Pricing sync now still applies official seed rows and local overrides when LiteLLM fallback fetch fails, and pricing status exposes effective rule counts by source and confidence.
- Cost Intelligence, Cache Doctor, Data Quality Center, Model Call Analytics, Quota Status, Watchdog events, evidence bundles, reconciliation imports, audit log, policy status, and expanded export types.
- Scoped Watchdog detection for runaway token/call density, calls per prompt, low output ratio, cache-miss risk, cost spikes, and non-working-hour usage, with stable insight-event upsert keys to avoid duplicate rows during dashboard refresh.
- Canonical Workload Ledger foundation with `canonical_events`, `workloads`, `agent_runs`, `model_calls`, `tool_calls`, `context_refs`, `artifacts`, `evaluations`, and `policy_decisions`.
- Workload dependency and lineage edges with `workload_links`, canonical `workload.linked` events, `POST /api/workloads/link`, `agent-ledger workload link`, and graph/timeline/detail projection for async goal DAGs.
- Queue-style workload claiming with `POST /api/workloads/claim-next`, `agent-ledger workload claim-next`, and MCP `ledger.claim_next_workload`; routers can atomically select the next claimable workload and create a lease in one SQLite transaction.
- Read-only workload queue probes with `GET /api/workloads/queue`, `agent-ledger workload queue`, and MCP `ledger.workload_queue`, reporting claimable counts, non-terminal status distribution, active/expired lease pressure, and next lease expiry without mutating SQLite.
- MCP resource `agent-ledger://workloads/queue` for read-only queue stats in agent context windows and router discovery flows.
- MCP resource `agent-ledger://workloads/leases` for privacy-safe lease context rows without workload ids, holders, purposes, or lease tokens.
- MCP resource `agent-ledger://agent-runs/liveness` for privacy-safe async run health context without run ids, workload ids, project metadata, goals, or status messages.
- Control-plane readiness now includes privacy-safe workload queue claimability and lease pressure buckets for router and deployment probes.
- Capability catalog readiness metadata now declares workload queue claimability and lease pressure data classes for integration discovery.
- MCP resource subscription cursors now ignore volatile `generated_at` fields, preventing queue/readiness subscriptions from emitting no-op router wakeups.
- `GET /api/workloads/queue` now emits stable `ETag` values and honors `If-None-Match` with `304 Not Modified` when only `generated_at` changes.
- Added workload claim queue indexes for repo and owner filters to keep scoped router probes efficient as workload history grows.
- Short-lived workload leases with `workload_leases`, `POST /api/workloads/lease`, `POST /api/workloads/lease/renew`, `POST /api/workloads/lease/release`, `GET /api/workloads/leases`, `agent-ledger workload lease`, and MCP `ledger.acquire_workload_lease` / `ledger.renew_workload_lease` / `ledger.release_workload_lease` / `ledger.workload_leases`; plaintext lease tokens are returned only on acquire and stored as SHA-256 hashes.
- Async run start, heartbeat, and liveness ledger with `agent_run_events`, run snapshot fields, `agent.run.heartbeat` canonical events, `POST /api/agent-runs`, `POST /api/agent-runs/heartbeat`, `GET /api/agent-runs/liveness`, `agent-ledger workload start-run|heartbeat|liveness`, and MCP `ledger.start_run` / `ledger.heartbeat_run` / `ledger.run_liveness`.
- Workload event feeds now include stable content cursors, `generated_at`, HTTP `ETag` / `304 Not Modified` support, and SSE `id` values so local routers and monitors can consume state changes incrementally.
- Metadata-only canonical event schema and ingest through storage, `GET /api/event-schema`, `POST /api/events`, `agent-ledger event schema/ingest`, and `ledger.event_schema` / `ledger.record_event`.
- Privacy-safe canonical event templates through `GET /api/event-examples`, `agent-ledger event examples`, MCP `ledger.event_examples`, and `agent-ledger://schema/canonical-event-examples`.
- Canonical event schema version gating now accepts only `v1`; unknown event-envelope versions fail validation explicitly.
- Canonical event dry-run validation through `POST /api/events/validate` and `agent-ledger event validate`, sharing ingest validation without mutating SQLite.
- Machine-readable adapter contract through `GET /api/integrations/adapter-spec`, `agent-ledger adapter spec`, MCP `ledger.adapter_contract`, and `agent-ledger://integrations/adapter-contract`, defining supported input kinds, privacy-forbidden fields, token semantics, quality gates, validation commands, and ingest entrypoints.
- Adapter conformance validation through `POST /api/integrations/conformance` and `agent-ledger adapter conformance`, covering canonical, provider, OpenTelemetry GenAI, and A2A fixtures without writing SQLite.
- Adapter conformance strict mode via `strict=true` or `--strict` treats provenance warnings as CI failures.
- Discovery manifests now expose first-class runtime, canonical schema, event examples, adapter spec, and adapter conformance URIs for wrappers and routers.
- Canonical event schema now includes a stable `schema_hash`, also surfaced in conformance reports and discovery manifests.
- Adapter fixture examples under `examples/adapter-fixtures/` cover canonical, provider, OpenTelemetry GenAI, and A2A strict conformance.
- Provider adapter fixtures now separately cover OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Chat Completions, and Anthropic Messages usage envelopes in CI.
- CI now builds the binary, checks embedded UI JavaScript syntax, and runs strict conformance against public adapter fixtures.
- MCP now exposes read-only `ledger.validate_event`, `ledger.adapter_contract`, and `ledger.adapter_conformance` tools so agents can inspect contracts and verify events or fixtures before writing.
- Canonical event provenance fields for future adapters: `schema_version`, `source_version`, `parser_version`, `raw_ref`, and `match_type`, persisted locally and included in offline bundle exports.
- Data Quality and Doctor provenance checks for canonical events, including schema/source/parser coverage, raw reference coverage, match-type mix, confidence, and UI panel visibility.
- Provenance metadata is now populated by OpenTelemetry, A2A, provider usage, and gateway adapters so downstream quality checks can distinguish source-reported data from reconstructed references.

- Optional local OpenAI Responses gateway through `POST /gateway/openai/v1/responses`, gated by `gateway.enabled`, supporting JSON and SSE streaming responses, environment-variable API keys, local policy checks, usage response metering from final `response.completed` events, and audit metadata without storing prompt or response content.

- Evidence bundles now include redacted ingestion health, pricing source/rule status, dashboard consistency, anomaly events, and watchdog events for data discrepancy investigations.
- Consistent dashboard bundle through `GET /api/dashboard`, so KPI, token, cost, and model panels read one storage snapshot and avoid mixed old/new states during scans.
- Canonical `model.call` events now project into `usage_records`, while legacy session backfill skips sessions already owned by canonical workloads to avoid duplicate workload rows.
- Pricing recalculation now updates canonical `model_calls` as well as `usage_records`, keeping workload detail costs aligned with dashboard and export totals.

- Local workload event feed through `GET /api/workload-events`, `GET /api/workload-events/stream`, and `agent-ledger workload feed`, deriving metadata-only phase/severity/next-action events for monitors, routers, and notification adapters.
- Disabled-by-default redacted webhook notifications through `POST /api/notifications/webhook` and `agent-ledger notify webhook`, with dry-run support, bounded event and pending-approval counts, audit logging, hashed request/workload/run ids, and forced redaction of goals, projects, repos, branches, teams, approval targets, approval reasons, and request payloads.
- `agent-ledger notify webhook --dry-run` is treated as a read-only CLI operation, allowing observer deployments to inspect redacted notification payloads without sending webhooks or mutating state.

### Security
