# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Kiro collector now supports dual data sources: SQLite database (`~/.local/share/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3`) and JSON/JSONL session files (`~/.kiro/sessions/cli/`). Both are scanned simultaneously with auto-detection based on path type.

### Changed
- Default Kiro config paths now include both data sources.
- Docker Compose examples include volume mount for `~/.kiro/sessions/cli`.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-06-05

### Changed
- kiro collection now uses `~/.local/share/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3` / `/sessions/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3` as the default and documented data source.
- Docker Compose examples now only mount existing agent data directories explicitly, with kiro using the SQLite data directory.

### Fixed
- Count kiro API calls from `conversations_v2.history[].request_metadata` so non-interactive kiro usage is included.
- Preserve concurrent same-millisecond kiro requests by deriving record timestamps from `request_id`.
- Reset old kiro scan state and usage records once so legacy JSON/JSONL counts do not mix with the new SQLite-only counts.
- Standardize user-facing source labels to `kiro`.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-07

### Changed
- Color palette: Financial Dashboard scheme (deep navy dark theme, cool white light theme)
- Chart colors: ECharts default palette with consistent model-to-color mapping
- Stat card font: Fira Code monospace for data terminal feel
- All i18n labels refined for clarity (zh: 总耗费→总费用, 提示数→Prompt数, etc.)
- Session Log title separated from Sessions stat card i18n key

### Fixed
- Filter input and select elements now properly styled in dark mode
- Project filter placeholder now follows i18n language setting

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- Sticky top bar merging header and controls into one component

- IBM Plex Mono / Fira Code for stat card numbers
- Project column text truncation with ellipsis
- Responsive breakpoints: 4-col → 2-col → 1-col stats grid
- Inter font loaded from Google Fonts
- Stat card hover lift animation
- Refresh button continuous spin animation
- OpenClaw badge styling

### Changed
- Panel order: Tokens → Cost → Sessions → Prompts (stat cards), Token Usage → Cost Trend → Cost by Model (charts)
- Charts layout: Token Usage full-width, Cost Trend 3/5, Cost by Model 2/5
- Cost trend chart: stacked bar by model (was line chart)
- Pie chart legend: top horizontal with scroll (was right vertical)
- Model color consistency: same model gets same color across pie and bar charts
- Header backdrop-filter fixed with proper RGB CSS variables

### Fixed
- Filter `<synthetic>` model records from Claude Code collector
- Filter `delivery-mirror` internal records from OpenClaw collector
- Clean up synthetic/delivery-mirror records from database on startup
