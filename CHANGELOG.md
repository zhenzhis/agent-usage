# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Official Agent Ledger naming across module path, binary, Docker, release metadata, and documentation.
- Pricing governance with local override, official OpenAI/Anthropic seed rows, LiteLLM fallback, pricing source health, snapshots, audit events, and per-record pricing confidence.
- Pricing sync now still applies official seed rows and local overrides when LiteLLM fallback fetch fails, and pricing status exposes effective rule counts by source and confidence.
- Cost Intelligence, Cache Doctor, Data Quality Center, Model Call Analytics, Quota Status, Watchdog events, evidence bundles, reconciliation imports, audit log, policy status, and expanded export types.
- Scoped Watchdog detection for runaway token/call density, calls per prompt, low output ratio, cache-miss risk, cost spikes, and non-working-hour usage, with stable insight-event upsert keys to avoid duplicate rows during dashboard refresh.
- Canonical Workload Ledger foundation with `canonical_events`, `workloads`, `agent_runs`, `model_calls`, `tool_calls`, `context_refs`, `artifacts`, `evaluations`, and `policy_decisions`.
- Async run start, heartbeat, and liveness ledger with `agent_run_events`, run snapshot fields, `agent.run.heartbeat` canonical events, `POST /api/agent-runs`, `POST /api/agent-runs/heartbeat`, `GET /api/agent-runs/liveness`, `agent-ledger workload start-run|heartbeat|liveness`, and MCP `ledger.start_run` / `ledger.heartbeat_run` / `ledger.run_liveness`.
- Metadata-only canonical event schema and ingest through storage, `GET /api/event-schema`, `POST /api/events`, `agent-ledger event schema/ingest`, and `ledger.event_schema` / `ledger.record_event`.

### Changed

- Default database name is `agent-ledger.db`.
- Default system config path is `/etc/agent-ledger/config.yaml`.
- Docker runtime binary is `/agent-ledger`.
- Go module path is `github.com/zhenzhis/agent-ledger`.

### Security

- Added RBAC configuration fields and role checks for side-effectful governance APIs.
- Added a read-only control plane mode for observer deployments that must not mutate local SQLite state.
- Added local audit logging for scan, pricing sync, recalculation, and reconciliation import operations.
- Exports can be forced into privacy mode by policy.
- Agent run commands are best-effort redacted for common API key, token, password, secret, and bearer patterns before persistence, including canonical run events.
- Release workflows now configure Syft SBOMs for GoReleaser archives and BuildKit SBOM/provenance attestations for GHCR images.
