# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Official Agent Ledger naming across module path, binary, Docker, release metadata, and documentation.
- Pricing governance with local override, official OpenAI/Anthropic seed rows, LiteLLM fallback, pricing source health, snapshots, audit events, and per-record pricing confidence.
- Cost Intelligence, Cache Doctor, Data Quality Center, Model Call Analytics, Quota Status, Watchdog events, evidence bundles, reconciliation imports, audit log, policy status, and expanded export types.
- Canonical Workload Ledger foundation with `canonical_events`, `workloads`, `agent_runs`, `model_calls`, `tool_calls`, `context_refs`, `artifacts`, `evaluations`, and `policy_decisions`.
- Async run heartbeat and liveness ledger with `agent_run_events`, run snapshot fields, `agent.run.heartbeat` canonical events, `POST /api/agent-runs/heartbeat`, `GET /api/agent-runs/liveness`, `agent-ledger workload heartbeat|liveness`, and MCP `ledger.heartbeat_run` / `ledger.run_liveness`.
- Metadata-only canonical event schema and ingest through storage, `GET /api/event-schema`, `POST /api/events`, `agent-ledger event schema/ingest`, and `ledger.event_schema` / `ledger.record_event`.
- Privacy-safe integration capability catalog through `GET /api/integrations`, `agent-ledger integrations`, and `ledger.integrations`, covering implemented collectors/protocols plus experimental provider gateway surfaces.
- OpenTelemetry GenAI JSON span mapping through `POST /api/otel/genai` and `agent-ledger otel convert|ingest`, projecting token metadata into canonical `model.call` plus hashed `context.ref` events while excluding prompt/completion message attributes.
- Optional local OTLP HTTP/JSON traces receiver through `POST /v1/traces` and `POST /api/otlp/v1/traces`, gated by `integrations.otlp_receiver.enabled` with body and span-count limits.
- A2A task telemetry mapping through `POST /api/a2a/tasks` and `agent-ledger a2a convert|ingest`, projecting task snapshots/events into workload, run, context, artifact, close, and evaluation events while excluding message/history/artifact-part content.
- Provider usage envelope mapping through `POST /api/provider/calls` and `agent-ledger provider convert|ingest`, supporting OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic-style, and LiteLLM-style usage objects while excluding request/response message content.
- Optional local OpenAI-compatible gateway through `POST /gateway/openai/v1/chat/completions`, gated by `gateway.enabled`, supporting JSON and SSE streaming responses, using environment-variable API keys, local policy checks, usage response metering, and audit metadata without storing prompt or response content.
- Gateway streaming requests now ask compatible upstreams for final usage chunks by default through `gateway.include_stream_usage`, while preserving explicit client `stream_options.include_usage` settings.
- Gateway ledger-context attribution for project, goal, workload id, run id, session id, and branch via query parameters or request metadata.
- Provider bill reconciliation import through `POST /api/reconciliation/import` and `agent-ledger reconcile import/status`, parsing local CSV/JSON statements into summary totals, statement hash, window, warnings, and local/provider cost diff.
- Model Router Simulator through `GET /api/router/simulate` and `agent-ledger router simulate`, estimating target-model routing savings from existing token components and pricing governance metadata without mutating ledger records.
- Preflight Cost Estimate through `GET /api/preflight/estimate` and `agent-ledger preflight`, estimating likely task cost/tokens/calls from local historical session medians and task-type multipliers.
- Team Chargeback/Showback through `GET /api/chargeback`, `GET /api/export?type=chargeback`, and `agent-ledger chargeback`, using raw usage as the authoritative source and canonical model calls only as fallback.
- Fleet Attribution through `GET /api/fleet-attribution` and `agent-ledger fleet`, reporting explicit sub-agent parent links, overlapping parallel runs, model-call totals, tokens, and costs.
- Agent Wrapped through `GET /api/wrapped` and `agent-ledger wrapped`, producing monthly/weekly/yearly Markdown or JSON summaries from metadata-only usage signals.
- One-click Doctor through `GET /api/doctor` and `agent-ledger doctor`, combining usage, ingestion health, pricing freshness, and data-quality checks into actionable JSON/Markdown diagnostics.
- Consistent dashboard bundle through `GET /api/dashboard`, so KPI, token, cost, and model panels read one storage snapshot and avoid mixed old/new states during scans.
- Canonical `model.call` events now project into `usage_records`, while legacy session backfill skips sessions already owned by canonical workloads to avoid duplicate workload rows.
- Pricing recalculation now updates canonical `model_calls` as well as `usage_records`, keeping workload detail costs aligned with dashboard and export totals.
- Doctor and Data Quality reports now include canonical-to-usage projection consistency checks for missing projections, cost mismatches, and duplicate legacy/canonical session owners.
- Canonical-to-usage projection repair through `POST /api/projections/repair` and `agent-ledger projection repair`, backfilling missing projected usage rows, realigning cache/cost metadata, and rebuilding usage aggregates.
- Advanced dashboard action for projection repair using the current time/source/model/project filters.
- Quota/Battery forecasts now include reset time, projected window usage, and estimated time-to-limit based on local burn rate.
- Session Cost Replay through `GET /api/session-replay` and `agent-ledger replay`, returning chronological per-call token/cost accumulation without reading prompt content.
- Repo AI Cost Badge through `GET /api/badge/repo.svg` and `agent-ledger badge`, rendering local black/white SVG cost, token, session, or cache badges.
- Offline bundle export/import for air-gapped multi-machine aggregation, with metadata-only canonical event replay, payload SHA-256 integrity, optional HMAC-SHA256 signing, CLI commands, and REST endpoints.
- Shared local policy evaluator across MCP, `POST /api/policy/evaluate`, and `agent-ledger policy evaluate`, with stable action severity and optional decision recording.
- Policy-aware export/report governance, recording policy decisions for export/report/evidence/offline-bundle operations and blocking configured `block` or `require_approval` actions.
- Local policy approval requests with `GET/POST /api/policy/approvals`, `agent-ledger policy approvals`, and `agent-ledger policy resolve`, allowing approved action/target retries by `approval_id`.
- Legacy session backfill into workload/run/model-call records for immediate compatibility with existing local data.
- Workload APIs: list/create/close/heartbeat/liveness/detail/graph, model registry, policy decisions, and workload CSV/JSON export.
- Local MCP stdio JSON-RPC tools for budget lookup, workload lifecycle, run heartbeat/liveness, privacy-safe artifacts, advisory policy decisions, cost explanation, and similar workload search.
- Local MCP resources and prompts for metadata-only schema/catalog/budget/workload/policy context plus workload, cost-review, and incident-evidence templates.
- Hourly and daily usage aggregate tables with dashboard aggregate fallback.
- CLI commands: `today`, `top`, `doctor`, `battery`, `workload list/create/show/close/heartbeat/liveness`, `run --goal ... -- <command>`, `export`, `pricing sync`, `router simulate`, `preflight`, `replay`, `badge`, and `wrapped`.
- Cursor-compatible session pagination via `next_cursor`.
- Black/white/gray data-dense dashboard panels for workloads, pricing, quota, quality, model calls, cache, watchdog, and cost intelligence.

### Changed

- Default database name is `agent-ledger.db`.
- Default system config path is `/etc/agent-ledger/config.yaml`.
- Docker runtime binary is `/agent-ledger`.
- Go module path is `github.com/zhenzhis/agent-ledger`.

### Security

- Added RBAC configuration fields and role checks for side-effectful governance APIs.
- Added local audit logging for scan, pricing sync, recalculation, and reconciliation import operations.
- Exports can be forced into privacy mode by policy.
- Release workflows now configure Syft SBOMs for GoReleaser archives and BuildKit SBOM/provenance attestations for GHCR images.

### Credits

- Agent Ledger remains based on the local-first foundation from [briqt/agent-usage](https://github.com/briqt/agent-usage). Thanks to the original author and contributors.
